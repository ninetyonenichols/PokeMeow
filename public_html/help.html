                    PokeMeow is a simplified, command-line version of Pokemon. It is based on the 
                    Discord bot “PokeMeow,” which allows users to catch (and soon, battle) Pokemon
                    within a chat window.

                        the complexities were in creating this project. The major components are 
                        server.js (routing), the db folder (database), and command.js (overall 
                        controller for the app). Server.js handles routing and sends requests to 
                        command.js. command.js then communicates with the database to produce data 
                        which is consumed by the client. Each component is discussed below. </li>
                    <li><span class="cmd">server.js: </span></li> 
                    <li><span class="cmd">command.js: </span></li>
                    <li><p><span class="cmd">db: </span> In addition to storing data, the database also
                        contains many static and instance methods which allow it to perform complex
                        tasks which are relevant to processing data. This allows it to actively help
                        with the execution of the app, rather than simply being a repository for data.
                        </p>
                        <p>It makes use of export / require statements to allow for better-organized
                        code. Specifically, the db.js file establishes the conneciton and then passes
                        this connection to each model, rather than having each model establish its own.
                        </p>
                        <p>Each file in db/models contains all the info needed to produce one model.
                        It makes heavy use of data validation, and it uses virtuals (attributes which
                        are derived from other attributes at runtime) to cut down on redundant code.
                        As described above, the static and instance methods allow the models + 
                        documents themselves to execute methods of their own. For example, the Pokemon
                        model has a 'create' function that allows it to essentially clone a pre-
                        existing Pokemon document, but with a new _id field. This way, a trainer can
                        encounter a unique "instance" of that pokemon.
                        </p>
                        <p>Much of the data has to be stored prior to starting up the app (for example,
                        data about each species of Pokemon). To accomplish this, the db/data folder
                        contains data structures which are imported using the 'mongoimport' utility,
                        as well as other data structures which are imported directly into other files.
                        This setup allows for the data to be manipulated with a text-editor and then
                        imported all at once to MongoDB. It also provdes a backup txt file, in case the
                        database were ever accidentally cleared.</p>
