This directory will contain raw-data files.

Some of these files can be used to initialize a 
collection. For example, types.json contains all the info needed to rebuild
the 'types' collection if it were ever cleared from the database.

To import types.json into the types collection, use the command below:

mongoimport --db pokemeow --collection types --file types.json
