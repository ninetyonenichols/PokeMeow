                    PokeMeow is a simplified, version of Pokemon. It is based
                    on the Discord bot “PokeMeow,” which allows users to catch
                    Pokemon and battle trainers.

                    <li><span class="cmd">Note to Ben + TAs: </span> This
                        section will describe where the complexities were in
                        creating this project. The major components are
                        server.js (routing), the db (database) folder, and
                        command.js (overall controller for the app). Server.js
                        handles routing and uses command.js to parse command
                        strings, execute them on the database, and finally send
                        back a response containing the output. Each component
                        is discussed below.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="cmd">server.js: </span> Server.js mainly
                        only handles file uploads, session authentication, and
                        a few different requests. To handle commands, it uses
                        the Command object constructor to first parse the
                        commands, then execute the command, and finally send
                        the output given by Command.execute().
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="cmd">command.js: </span> This and the
                        database are the workhorses of the app, and consists of
                        a Command object constructor. It contains three
                        functions for parsing user command strings (this app
                        started out originally with the intention of having
                        users submit commands using a text input, but now
                        utilizes buttons instead). These functions set the
                        'execute' method in the Command object to be equal to
                        the appropriate execution method (for example,
                        'this.execute = this.execParty'). By doing this,
                        server.js only needs to call Command.execute() after
                        parsing the command to execute it. The various
                        execution methods all interact with the database in
                        some way to generate and format the output from the
                        command, which is then sent directly to the client in
                        server.js.
                    </li>
                    <li><p><span class="cmd">db: </span> In addition to storing
                            data, the database alsocontains many static and
                            instance methods which allow it to perform complex
                            tasks which are relevant to processing data. This
                            allows it to actively help with the execution of
                            the app, rather than simply being a repository for
                            data.
                        </p>
                        <p>It makes use of export / require statements to allow
                            for better-organized code. Specifically, the db.js
                            file establishes the conneciton and then passes
                            this connection to each model, rather than having
                            each model establish its own connection.
                        </p>
                        <p>Each file in db/models contains all the info needed
                            to produce one model. It makes heavy use of data
                            validation, and it uses virtuals (attributes which
                            are derived from other attributes at runtime) to
                            cut down on redundant code. As described above, the
                            static and instance methods allow the models +
                            documents themselves to execute methods of their
                            own. For example, the Pokemon model has a 'create'
                            function that allows it to essentially clone a pre-
                            existing Pokemon document, but with a new _id
                            field. This way, a trainer can encounter a unique
                            "instance" of that pokemon.
                        </p>
                        <p>Much of the data has to be stored prior to starting
                            up the app (for example, data about each species of
                            Pokemon). To accomplish this, the db/data folder
                            contains data structures which are imported using
                            the 'mongoimport' utility, as well as other data
                            structures which are imported directly into other
                            files. This setup allows for the data to be
                            manipulated with a text-editor and then imported
                            all at once to MongoDB. It also provdes a backup
                            txt file, in case the database were ever
                            accidentally cleared.
